My name is Bing Theodore Zhang, and my Chinese name is 张兵. I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Scholar at the Department of Physics and Institute for Gravitation & the Cosmos (IGC) at the Pennsylvania State University.

My research 
======

My current research interests are on multi-messenger astrophysics, especially on ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs), high-energy neutrinos, and very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-rays.

I am also working for the GRAND300 project, especially contribute to the design of a conventional ground array (i.e., array of water-Cherenkov detectors) for hybrid detection of the extensive air showers. 

## Theory

### The origin and composition of UHECRs 

Possible source candidates:
* Low-luminosity gamma-ray bursts

* Engine-driven supernova

* Tidal disruption events

* Radio galaxies

### The origin of high-energy neutrinos 

* TXS 0506+056: IceCube-170922A

* TDE AT2019dsg: IceCube-191001A

### The origin of VHE gamma-rays
