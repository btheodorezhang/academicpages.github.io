My name is Bing Theodore Zhang. I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Scholar at the Department of Physics and Institute for Gravitation & the Cosmos (IGC) at the Pennsylvania State University.

My current research interests are on multi-messenger astrophysics, especially on the origin of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs), high-energy neutrinos, and very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-rays.

I am also interested in Experiments. I am working for the GRAND300 project on the design of a conventional ground array (i.e., array of water-Cherenkov detectors) for hybrid detection of the extensive air showers.
