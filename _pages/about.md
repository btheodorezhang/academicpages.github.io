My name is Bing Theodore Zhang. I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Scholar at the Pennsylvania State University

My research 
======

## Theory
------
I am working on multi-messenger astrophysics, especially on ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs), high-energy neutrinos, and very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-rays

### Project: The origin and composition of UHECRs 

Possible candidates:

* Low-luminosity gamma-ray bursts

* Engine-driven supernova

* Tidal disruption events

* Radio galaxies

### Project: The origin of high-energy neutrinos 
We proposed 

* IceCube-170922A
We show

* IceCube-191001A
We show

### Project: The origin of VHE gamma-rays
We proposed 

## Experiment
------
I am a member of [The Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND)](https://grand.cnrs.fr)
